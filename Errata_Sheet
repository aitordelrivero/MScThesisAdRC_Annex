- Eq. 3.26. in Page 19 of the Thesis Report DOES include the intrinsic capacitance:
  (2/3 W L e0 eSi02 / Tox) is the Meyer model for the intrinstic capacitance between the gate and the source in saturation. 
  Cgso is the overlap capacitance (extrinsic).
  
- Eq 3.26. in Page 16 is missing a W multiplying Cgso.
 
- The broken references in Page 23 point towards citation #36 (Middlebrook, 2006)

- In page 29, line 4, "considering only the extrinsic capacitances" should be removed.

- In page 30, the caption of Figure 4.3 should switch the references to graph B) and C).

- In Table 4.7., page 48, Vsat, VGS and Vth are absolute values. Therefore, they should be written as |Vsat|, |VGS| and |Vth|.
