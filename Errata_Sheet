- Eq. 3.26. in Page 19 of the Thesis Report DOES include the intrinsic capacitance:
  (2/3 W L e0 eSi02 / Tox) is the Meyer model for the intrinstic capacitance between the gate and the source in saturation. 
  Cgso is the overlap capacitance which is the main contributor to the extrinsic capacitance.
